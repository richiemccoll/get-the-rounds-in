This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project also uses:
- some Semantic UI React components (for quick prototyping) and styled-components to replace parts of the semantic UI that I didn't like.
- Redux for most of application state.
- Jest snapshot tests for the components.
- Enzyme and Chai assertions for the action creators and reducers.
